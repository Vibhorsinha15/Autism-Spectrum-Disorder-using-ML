# 🧠 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a predictive model that helps in the early identification of autism traits based on behavioural, social, and demographic data.

## 📌 Project Objective

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting communication and behaviour. Early detection plays a crucial role in treatment and support. This notebook applies machine learning algorithms to a preprocessed dataset to predict whether an individual is likely to have ASD.

## 🚀 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing values and encoding categorical features
- Data normalization and preparation
- Model training using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Final prediction and model comparison

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes responses to screening questions and demographic features such as age, gender, ethnicity, and family history. The target variable indicates whether the individual is likely to have ASD.
